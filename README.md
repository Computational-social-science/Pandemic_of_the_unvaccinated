# Pandemic_of_the_unvaccinated

The Covid pandemic has entered a new phase in which vaccination is the determinant of ["zero covid"](https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1794) attainment, making policymaking fraught with challenges. Unfortunately, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), phrased current Covid as a [‘_pandemic of the unvaccinated_’](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/16/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-45/) at a press briefing on 16 July 2021. Since that, the dubbed [‘_pandemic of the unvaccinated_’](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/16/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-45/) has taken the epicenter of [COVID-19 infodemic](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200202-sitrep-13-ncov-v3.pdf). Still, little is known about the knock-on effects of such controversial tsunami.
