Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), phrased current Covid as a [‘_pandemic of the unvaccinated_’](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/16/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-45/) at a press briefing on 16 July 2021. Since that, the dubbed [‘_pandemic of the unvaccinated_’](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/16/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-45/) has taken the epicenter of [COVID-19 infodemic](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200202-sitrep-13-ncov-v3.pdf). However, the unintended consequences of such tsunami remain unknown.
